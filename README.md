Expense Tracker App â€“ Salesforce Lightning Web Components Application

The Expense Tracker App is a Salesforce-based system for managing employee expenses, built using Lightning Web Components (LWC), Apex classes, and custom objects. Employees can submit expense requests with details like Date, Category, Amount, Description, and Receipt, edit pending requests, and track status updates. Managers can view all team expenses, approve or reject requests, and add comments through a centralized dashboard.

The application uses a custom Expense__c object and Apex controllers to enforce role-based access, handle business logic, and ensure data integrity. The frontend provides a responsive, user-friendly interface, while the backend ensures secure and efficient processing.

Developed in 10 phases, the project includes environment setup, object creation, Apex and LWC development, Lightning App setup, UAT, workflow testing, performance optimization, and final verification. The Expense Tracker App is a production-ready, scalable solution that streamlines expense management and approval workflows.
