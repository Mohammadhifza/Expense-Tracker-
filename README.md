# Expense-Tracker-
Expense Tracker App â€“ A Salesforce Lightning Web Components Application for Managing Employee Expenses

This application provides a complete expense management system built on the Salesforce platform using Lightning Web Components (LWC), Apex classes, and custom objects. It allows employees to submit expense requests and managers to approve or reject them with real-time status updates.

The project includes a custom Expense__c object with fields for Date, Category, Amount, Description, Receipt, Status, User, and Manager Comment. The frontend is built using Lightning Web Components with a clean, responsive interface that works across desktop and mobile devices. The backend uses Apex controllers to handle data operations and business logic with role-based access control.

Employees can:

Submit new expense requests.

Edit pending requests.

Track the status of their submissions.

Managers can:
